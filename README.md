Access to Affordable Finance: Unlocking Access to Finance for the Next Generation of Agripreneurs
Background:
Access to affordable finance remains one of the biggest barriers preventing young Nigerians from entering agriculture.
According to the EFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 survey, only 27% of rural adults have access to formal financial services. Among young people aged 18â€“25, access to loans for business purposes is even lower at 6%.
Meanwhile, agriculture employs about 35% of Nigeriaâ€™s workforce (World Bank, 2022), but contributes less than 25% to the GDP â€” suggesting underinvestment.
Commercial banks often consider agriculture "too risky" because of factors like climate variability, land tenure issues, and lack of credit history. Without access to credit, young farmers cannot invest in seeds, technology, irrigation, or machinery needed to boost yields and incomes.
How can we use data to bridge this finance gap and make agriculture a bankable, attractive industry for youth?
